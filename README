You need a credentials.json file.
Go to: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials
(if needed, create a project), then an OAuth credential. Download the file
as credentials.json in the root directory.

more info here:
https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python
(using this link will create a project called Quickstart with the API enabled.)
